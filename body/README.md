# OpenBot: Robot Body


## Building your own

You can build any wheeled robot body around a microcontroller such as the Arduino Nano to use with the OpenBot software stack. We have designed a [3D-printed body](diy) for a wheeled robot which relies on low-cost, readily available hobby hardware. [OpenBot Lite](lite) is a smaller and simplified variant of the OpenBot DIY version developed for education.
